**Live stream your device's camera feed accessible from anywhere with WebRTC and balena**

## Highlights

- **Stream your Pi's camera feed**: Use WebRTC to capture and view your camera feed in a web browser.
- **Access your stream remotely**: Get a public URL to access your balenaCam feed from anywhere.
- **Focus on privacy**: Your camera feeds directly from your device to the browser feed-- no third-party camera service required.

**Note:** You'll want to start a [free balenaCloud account](https://dashboard.balena-cloud.com/signup) first. Your initial ten devices are fully-featured, free of charge, and don't require a payment method to start. Hack to your heart's content.

## Documentation

Head over to our [docs](/docs/getting-started) for detailed installation and usage instructions, customization options and more.

## Motivation

We created this open source project to provide a way to stream a camera feed to a browser with privacy in mind. Having read about too many insteances of breached privacy from popular solutions in the market, we built an alternative method that utilizes single-board devices, your own network, and balena tools.

balenaCam is lightweight, uses WebRTC, and is designed to be open and adaptable to become a part of other edge or IoT projects where a user needs streaming video for their project.

This project is in active development so if you have any feature requests or issues please submit them here on GitHub. PRs are welcome, too.
